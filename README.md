# Flutter-IDE

An IDE for Flutter written in Flutter.

## Module overview

### Visual Components

Are the building blocks for the visual editor. They themselves are not
execrable on their own. Rather they are used by the App-Linker to enable
visual editing.

### App-Linker

A server which handles all source code translations. Editing source values
goes through this server.

### The IDE, which contains all the IDE code.
